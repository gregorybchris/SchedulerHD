This was a three-week project I worked on with a friend over the summer before our senior year of high school to allow students and teachers to compare their class schedules. The main service provided was that students wanted to more easily see who would be in their classes and lunch periods during the year. Additionally students could use this program to schedule meetings with teachers and other students for meetings and group projects during the year based on common free periods.
